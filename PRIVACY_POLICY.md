# Privacy Policy for My Grocery List

**Last Updated:** 7th November 2025

Thank you for using My Grocery List, a simple shopping list application.

### Information We Collect

Our application collects and stores the following information:

*   **Shopping List Data:** The items, quantities, and names that you add to your shopping list.

This data is generated by you and is stored locally on your device using the device's internal storage. We do not have access to this information, and it is not uploaded to any external servers.

### How We Use Your Information

We use the information you provide solely to enable the functionality of the app:

*   To display and manage your shopping list.
*   To save your list for future use on your device.
*   To share your list content with other applications, but only when you explicitly use the "Share List" feature.

### Information Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties. When you use the "Share List" functionality, you are using your device's native sharing feature to send your list's content to another person or application of your choice. We do not control the recipient or the application you choose to share with.

### Data Security

Your shopping list data is as secure as your device. We rely on the security of your mobile operating system to keep your data safe. Since the data is not transmitted to us, the risk of a remote data breach is eliminated.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the application. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
